**TL;DR**
GraphRAG replaces vector search with a lightweight knowledge-graph index and a map-reduce summarization step.
The result: LLMs can tackle global questions such as “What themes span this entire corpus?” while remaining fast and token-efficient. In head-to-head tests against GPT-4-powered vector RAG, GraphRAG won 72-83 % of comparisons on answer comprehensiveness and 62-82 % on diversity, while using up to 97 % fewer context tokens for some query modes.

# Why Does Classic RAG Break Down?
Traditional (vector) RAG excels when answers exist in a handful of chunks that fit the model's context window. Global "sensemaking" questions, however, require reasoning across the entire corpus rather than just the top-k nearest neighbours. Sensemaking tasks require reasoning over **connections** which can be among entities (persons, places) and relations between them. A query like "What overarching themes emerge across the entire dataset?" makes this clear. 

To address this limitation, [Microsoft proposed and implemented GraphRAG](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/) which has become one of the most popular approaches. In this article, we will dive into how GraphRAG works, explore its key innovations, and see why it is proving so effective for global reasoning tasks.


GraphRAG reframes such global queries as query-focused summarization (QFS) tasks and supplies the model with pre-digested, graph-structured knowledge instead of raw text.
